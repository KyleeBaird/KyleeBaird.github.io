        <h2>What makes a dog a hero?</h2>
        <p>What makes a dog a hero? Like myself and many others, dogs play a crutial part in our lives! A dog is a companion, there to emotionally support you, and to fufill all your needs. A dog can be a hero to help their owners accoplish their dreams without giving up!</p>
        <p>Doc is a 4 year old Mcnab. For those of you who do not know what a Mcnab is, they are a cattle dog! Doc is energetic, playful, and full of emotions. His energy keeps me rolling through the long days at school or work. His playfulness keeps me busy for the times I need a little pick-me-up! And lastly, his emotions bring me joy every day! Dogs can be a hero too!</p>
